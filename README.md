# agents-wordpress

Repo of AI-facing coding standards adapted from WordPress and related guides.

**Author:** Dax Castellon — daxcastellon@pm.me

## What’s here

- `AGENTS.md`: entry point with links to the language rule summaries.
- `agent-docs/`: concise rules the agent must follow for each language (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Markdown).
- Source standards (`*-coding-standards.md`, `*-documentation-standards.md`, `markdown-style-guide.md`) used to derive the agent rules.

## How to use

- When generating code or docs, consult `AGENTS.md` then the specific file in `agent-docs/`.
- For full detail or updates, refer back to the source standards in the repo and sync any changes into `agent-docs/`.
- Keep new contributions consistent with both the project’s linters/formatters and the summarized standards.
