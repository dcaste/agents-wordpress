# Markdown Agent Rules

Guidelines distilled from `markdown-style-guide.md`.

- **Headings**: Use `#`-prefixed headings (`#`–`######`), with a single H1 per document and a logical hierarchy.
- **Emphasis**: Italic with `_text_`; bold with `**text**`; strikethrough with `~~text~~`.
- **Lists**: Use `-` for unordered lists; indent sub-items by two spaces. Ordered lists use `1.`, `2.`, etc.
- **Links & blockquotes**: Links as `[text](https://example.com/)`. Blockquotes start with `>`; add more `>` for nesting.
- **Code**: Inline code with backticks. Fenced code blocks with language identifiers when possible (e.g., ```javascript).
- **Tables & rules**: Tables use header separators with `-` and `|`. Horizontal rules are `---` on a line by itself.
- **AI must**: Keep heading hierarchy clear (single H1), use `-` for unordered lists, prefer fenced code blocks with language tags, and follow link/blockquote/table patterns consistently.
